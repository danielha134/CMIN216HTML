            <p>Riot Games was founded in 2006 to develop, publish, and support the most player-focused games in the world. In 2009, they released their debut title, League of Legends, to worldwide acclaim. League has gone on to be the most-played PC game in the world and a key driver of the explosive growth of esports. </p>
            <p>Below are some of the games developed by Riot Games.</p>

            <h5>League of Legends</h5>
            <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"><img src="images/lol.png" alt="league of legends" width="250"></a>
            <p>In League of Legends, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team.  A team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.</p>

            <h5>Teamfight Tactics</h5>
            <a href="https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" target="_blank"><img src="images/tftb.png" alt="teamfight tactics" width="300"></a>
            <p>In Teamfight Tactics, players compete online against seven other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing.  The battlefield consists of hexagons, where players can strategically place units on the hexagons on their side of the game board between rounds. During each round, a short battle automatically commences, with two players matched randomly for that round.  Health lost from losing a round is calculated every round, and last player standing wins.</p>

            <a href="https://playruneterra.com/en-us/" target="_blank"><img src="images/lor.png" alt="legends of runeterra" width="300"></a>
            <p>Players play one versus one to reduce their opponent's health to zero. Cards come in a variety of types and belong to one of ten regionsâ€”groups of cards with a similar gameplay identity.  The regions originated in the wider League of Legends expanded universe. There are three types of card: champions, followers, and spells.  Champion cards are the playable characters from League of Legends.</p>

            <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_blank"><img src="images/vvb.png" alt="valorant" width="300"></a>
            <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future.  Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives.  The match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match.</p>
